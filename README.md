EatMeet

- A Javascript based application that allows users to search for restaurants around them and nominate their choice of restaurant for a vote among their group of friends to decide where they would be dining. To use the app, You must register first at https://foursquare.com/developers/ to recieve your own Foursquare client ID and client secret. This service is free. Once you have registered, click the gear icon near the seach-bar and paste your Foursquare client ID and client secret. 

- The application solves the issue of indecisiveness, when it comes to group dining, by allowing users to communicate their prefernces via the application and also providing a voting tool for them to reach a consensus. The app also pin points all the nominated restaurants on a map so users can see where each nomination is located. Therefore, eliminating the need for the often undersirable back and forth communication between a group when trying to decide where to dine.
